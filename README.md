With which algorithm is your accuracy higher? Could you explain why?
Gaussian Naive Bayes has an accuracy score of 53.49%, however linear SVM has a higher score of 62.21%. Thus, the SVM Algorithm performs well in this scenario with the same test size and random state. This could be because SVM offers greater flexibility in selecting alternative kernel functions to address various data distribution patterns, and linear SVM is more appropriate for complicated and non-linearly separable datasets. For complicated datasets, Gaussian Naive Bayes is less reliable than Support Vector Machines (SVM) because it presupposes feature independence.
There are other parameters that complicate the prediction, and the 215 rows of data we have are hardly enough to train the model. Thus,SVM Algorithm is best suited for this data since the data is small.
